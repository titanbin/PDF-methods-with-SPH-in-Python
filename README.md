# PDF methods with SPH in Python
A Python Script that simulates Turbulent Flow through Lagrangian PDF methods. Integrates [Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation) via a Monte Carlo approach of simulated fluid particles.
Includes mean fluid quantities computation via [Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics).

The SDEs implemented are from the Refined Langevin Model (RLM).

# How to run
1. Open `main.py` and change input parameters.
2. Run `main.py`.
